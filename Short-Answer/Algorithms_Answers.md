#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This is O(n) which is linear time. It is O(n) because as the size of the input increases, the 
runtime or space used grows at the same rate


b) This is O(n log n) which is Linearithmic. It is this because as the size of the input increases, the runtime or space used grows at a slightly faster rate. This is not ideal but better than other runtimes.


c) This function is being called recursively n times before reaching base case so its O(n).
